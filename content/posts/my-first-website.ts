I've always wanted to have my own website—even though I know it isn't really related to my research career. Still, the idea of having my own little room in the digital space felt exciting and meaningful.

If you're curious about the things I'm exploring, feel free to look around. And if anything resonates with you, don't hesitate to reach out!
